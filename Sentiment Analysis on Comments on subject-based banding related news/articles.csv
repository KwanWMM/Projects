0,0,Yahoo Poll: Is it a good thing to replace streaming with subject-based banding?,"From 2024, secondary school students will no longer be streamed into Normal and Express classes, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (5 March). Instead, subject-Based Banding (SBB) will see students taking higher- and lower-level subjects based on their ability.
According to Ong, the Full SBB will also enable schools to “reshape the social environment in schools to benefit their students”. Some 25 secondary schools will implement this starting in 2020.

1,1,Budget 2019 debate: Subject-Based Banding to replace streaming in secondary schools by 2024,"From 2024, secondary school students will no longer be streamed into Normal and Express classes, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (5 March).
Secondary 1 students in the 2024 batch will instead undergo Subject-Based Banding (SBB), which will see them taking higher and lower levels subjects based on their ability and strengths, he announced during the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Committee of Supply debate in Parliament.
“Our plan is that, by 2024, all students enrolling into Secondary 1 will go through a four-year curriculum, for all subject bands,” said the 49-year-old.
Subjects such as maths, history and literature will be taught at G1, G2 or G3 levels, with “G” standing for “General”. When these students reach Secondary 4 in 2027, they will take a common examination and graduate with a common secondary school certificate.
“It will list the subjects completed and the standard band of each subject. Singapore and Cambridge will co-brand this new certificate, as both are strong international brand names in education, which will enhance the recognition and value of the certificate,” Ong added.
“With full subject-based banding implemented, form classes re-organised across the board, and a combined secondary education certificate, we would have effectively merged Express, Normal (A) and Normal (Technical) streams into a single course.
“The Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams, and their labels, will therefore be phased out.”
A major policy shift
The announcement is the culmination of a policy that was first formalised in 2014 when SBB was adopted in 12 pilot secondary schools. This allowed Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students to take English, Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), Maths and Science at a higher standard.
Ong said the results of the pilot scheme have been “encouraging”, with about half of the Normal (Academic) students in these schools taking up subjects at the Express level. Some 25 per cent took one Express level subject, while another 11 per cent took two subjects, he added.
“To illustrate, for the national examinations in 2018, 25 per cent of Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) students who took O-level English got A1 or A2, compared to 24 per cent for Express students. For O-level Maths, 26 per cent of Normal (Academic) students got A1 or A2, compared to 50 per cent for Express students. For O-level Combined Science, it was 33 per cent for N(A), compared to 34 per cent for Express students,” said Ong.
“The Normal stream students have held their own.”
Beginning next year, about 25 pilot secondary schools will implement Full SBB. This will allow lower secondary school students to study more subjects such as geography, history and literature at a higher standard.
“We will also allow students of one stream the flexibility to take a subject offered in another stream,” said Ong.
Reshaping schools’ ‘social environment’
The Full SBB will also enable schools to “reshape the social environment in schools to benefit their students”.
Ong cited the example of Boon Lay Secondary, which previously had a problem with absenteeism and late-coming among its students.
Noticing that students were more engaged when it came to co-curricular activities (CCAs), the school’s principal re-organised form classes by CCA groups. While they would attend morning assembly in their CCA groups, students would break into different SBB classes for academic lessons.
“Almost immediately, late-coming and absenteeism rates plunged,” said Ong in describing the school’s “unprecedented” move.
How streaming came about
Ong also explained that streaming was implemented during the “efficiency-driven” phase of the education system in the 1980s and 1990s, when the government was concerned about the high primary school dropout rate.
“Through streaming, we customised education according to the learning rates of our students. It has successfully reduced school attrition rates from about a one-third of every cohort in the 1970s to less than 1 per cent today,” said Ong.
But he also acknowledged the downsides of streaming, such as a margin of error and the “certain stigmas” that it places upon students.
“Implementing Full SBB will be a multi-year transition. We should not underestimate the challenge of this move.
“There are major operational challenges, such as time-tabling. Schools will need time to learn, adapt and innovate,” said Ong."
2,2,Yahoo Poll: Would it be an issue for you if your Express child mixed with Normal stream kids?,"A Singapore mother of a three has suddenly come under fire online after expressing her opinion about school students who may not do well academically. Housewife Wendy Chan told Straits Times that she would rather not have her kids have anything to do with those in the “Normal” school stream.
According to ST, Chan said: “It’s because of their upbringing — their mindset and values may not be in tandem with what I agree with.”
Do you agree with this woman? That is, if you had children in the Express school stream, would you prefer they didn’t mix with kids from Normal stream? Have your say in our poll and leave a comment below."
3,3,Remove streaming in secondary schools to reduce social stratification: Louis Ng,"The Ministry of Education (MOE) should consider eliminating streaming in secondary schools in order to reduce social stratification among students, said Nee Soon GRC Member of Parliament Louis Ng on Wednesday (27 February).
Speaking in Parliament during the Budget 2019 debate, Ng called for stronger focus on adopting subject-based banding in secondary schools.
Subject-based banding, which has been introduced in primary and secondary schools, gives students the option of choosing a combination of standard and foundation subjects, depending on their strengths.
While streaming has helped to drastically reduce the attrition rate among students over the decades, it has also led to a hardening of social stratification and less social mixing, Ng said.
Students in the Normal stream tend to have lower social economic status than those from the Express stream, Ng pointed out. For instance, 69 per cent of secondary school students who received help from the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme between 2014 and 2018 were from the Normal stream, he added.
The MP said, “I am sure streaming was not meant to divide our nation by social economic status, but we now see streaming does contribute to it. We have tried so hard to prevent social stratification in our homes; we must try just as hard to do so in our schools.”
There is also a lack of mobility between streams. A student who is from the Normal (Technical) stream has a less than one per cent chance of moving to the Express stream, according to Ng, citing MOE data.
This stratification continues up the education ladder, with only 5 per cent of Normal (Technical) students progressing to graduate from public polytechnics and only 1 per cent of them graduating from autonomous universities, Ng pointed out.
One reason that could account for the lack of mobility between streams is the psychological barrier that Normal stream students face, Ng said. For some of them, there is a strong stigma associated with the stream and they end up suffering from low self-esteem.
The animal welfare activist has also addressed streaming in previous parliamentary sessions.
In his reply to Ng’s question on the issue last week, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said, “(Streaming) has very successfully lowered student attrition and improved educational outcomes.” Ong added that studies have shown that Normal (Academic) students have a similar level of confidence in their studies compared with Express stream students after spending some years in secondary school.
The minister, however, acknowledged, “But there is also feedback from teachers that students in Normal streams may over time also lose confidence and the mindset of growth and development. The trade-off between customisation and stigmatisation is something we need to recognise.”
In concluding his speech, Ng noted that the MOE had been shifting focus to aptitude of students instead of academic achievement and removing rankings.
Ng said, “I know that streaming is a sacred cow and this practice has existed for many decades. Members will know that I don’t like to cull animals but sir it really is time to slay this sacred cow.”"
