      "Our elites are implementing this new system due to their political consideration. Let me list some of them below:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1) Social stratification is gradually emerging in school\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is getting more common to see more and more non-Chinese students in the technical or normal stream while the Chinese students filled up the majority of the slots in the express stream. For political consideration, our authority is trying to 'break up' the huge pools of non-Chinese students in the technical or normal stream by merging them with the Chinese students in the express stream but they would not be able to do that with our current streaming system, which effectively reinforces the stratification due to the differences in the students' ability.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is because if you allow too many non-Chinese students to concentrate in a particular area (technical or normal stream classes etc), there is always a political risk that they would band together as a race (especially the Malays who are more united as a race as compared to the Chinese who tend to be self-interested individuals) and turn against the authority. Our political elites want people to unite so they are able to compete better as a group, but not to the extent that the people are so united as to be able to threaten the system or our elites themselves. This is a delicate balancing act that our elites want to maintain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this new system, they would be able to merge them into the same class - by combining a smarter 13-year-old Chinese student with a slower but older 14-year-old non-Chinese student in the same class!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you don't believe me, just take a look around the schools and see the race stratification for yourself that is currently present in our schools. Even for our tertiary institution like polytechnics, after 6 pm, the whole polytechnic would suddenly turn into a 'non-Chinese campus' as the majority of the part-time diploma students who attend night classes are non-Chinese! It becomes a Chinese institution during day-time and a non-Chinese institution at night-time!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) Divide and control\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As mentioned in (1), our political elites are not doing away with school streaming out of their goodwill or kind heart, they are doing this out of their self-interest and political necessity - to 'break up' the huge pools of non-Chinese students concentrated in an area by merging them with the rest. Our elites know that these students would still be able to mix well enough for them to perform in school but not to the extent that they become united enough as a race to form a credible threat to our elites. This is their true agenda - to divide and control when these students are young and not united yet. This is actually a pre-emptive measure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would also like to bring to people's attention some of the social stratifications that are already present in the workforce and in the government, if our elites are serious in eliminating such phenomenon, they should look into them seriously as well. Some examples are:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1) Why the majority of the frontline of our Singapore Police Force is stuffed with non-Chinese? Since when does our SPF become a non-Chinese force?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2) Why the majority of the frontline counters of our various government agencies (like CPF, HDB, ICA etc) are stuffed with Malays or Indians? The Chinese cannot do frontline counter jobs? Why are the Chinese so special? Are Malays born to do counter jobs?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3) Why are SMRT staff mostly non-Chinese?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4) Why are grab food, food panda delivery guys mostly non-Chinese?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And many more examples as well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even though my highest qualification is 'O' Level, I actually prefer our current streaming system because it allowed me to mix with people who are similar to me, in terms of intellectual level. In my period, we were able to converse well in various topics and since we were also of the same age, we were able to bond well with one another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Personally, in this new system, I think I would find it unbearable to mix with someone who cannot even understand moderate English, these people are so annoying and stupid and I would find it insulting that they are even in the same class as myself and sitting beside me!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Try mixing long enough with these stupid people and you would end up becoming stupid yourself in time! Stupidity is infectious!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

It even goes against Singapore’s motto Onwards and upwards. All levels must have a clear path to excellence and not every program fits every child. If express is a great system for the top tier, don’t change it. Fix what’s broken, provide a path, in one direction, upwards, for all students. Have a transition program for students that are identified as late bloomers, smart, but needing some motivation, etc. The fact is, philosophers and plowmen, each must do their part, to mold a better Singapore\r\n",
