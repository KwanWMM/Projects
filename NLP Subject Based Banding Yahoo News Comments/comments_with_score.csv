37,0.0,"This is a good move because it allows individuals to shine through their respective strengths and have the opportunity to strive for improvement in their weaker subjects so as to be promoted to a higher level if they improve.

However, the ideal situation would be to allow students and parents to decide on their own learning journeys by dropping the criteria for entry to each level.

It is not a good idea to remove the PSLE though. Instead, remove the entry criteria but offer recommendations. Make it very clear that standards will not be lowered to accommodate weaker learners if they choose to take on what appears to be beyond their ability. Then let the students and parents decide. Only then can they truly explore their potential, take risks and learn to be responsible adults who understand the consequences of personal choices. People are more enthusiastic when tackling challenges they have chosen.

The only problem is, this might take a toll on ‘success’ rates. Are we prepared to take the risk of not being seen as ‘number 1’ in educational ‘success’ rates? Do we choose numerical success over longer term resilience and excellence in life? Are bragging rights important? Why do some always blame the government and foreigners for robbing them of their jobs and opportunities? One reason might be that they do not know how to handle/competition because the government has always done everything for them, including deciding their future.

But the bottom line is, times have changed and our young ones really need to learn how to handle the realities of life and take responsibility for their choices instead of blaming others, take unethical short cuts when the going gets tough or, worse, take their own lives to escape the hard knocks.

Parents too, will no longer be able to blame the government for this or that because they will have to take responsibility for their children and choices as well.

If the MOE wants our future generations to be innovative and take risks, it will be more convincing to lead by example.

46,0.0,"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

To improve our competitiveness in Global Economy , We really must REVAMP our entire school education system , in actual fact, it should have been Done it in over 20 years ago, during the 1990s .

From this website on “ Subject-Based Banding to replace streaming in secondary schools by 2024 by Singapore Government , it has EXPOSE OUT these BIG PROBLEMS in Singapore that had spread over many years .

Unfortunately, our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ don’t seem to do much on it , though TALK very BIG in Mass Media that our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ is doing so ! ! !

The PROBLEMS that we are facing now are these , due to the very Harmful Effects of "" DON' T CARE "" of or , should say, SACRIFICE Professional Ethics & Moral Education for many years :===>

(1). Bad CORORATE CULTURES & Unethical SOCIAL VALUES are widespread in Singapore Business World & Singapore Society .

Even our so called "" MOST CLEAN & UNCORRUPTED CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD "" , which is Singapore Civil Service , are now affected, due to Big Scandals had happened over these few years, like of SEX – FOR - CONTRACT , SEX – FOR - GRADE , SEX - FOR - FAVOURS, UNDER - TABLE FAVORTISM , CORRUPTION , ABUSE of POWER , INTENTIONAL IRRESPONSIBLE ACTS & etc. .

(2). LACK of INTEREST on the Singaporean on things that affect National Interests & the Well-being of Society , which have led to the terrible consequences of Neglect .

[ WORST , it had led to INFLUENCIAL People , like so called “ ELITE CLASS “ as mention in here , that are Unethical HYPOCRITES & Big CHEATERS ( Like T T Durai , Richard Yong , Peter Lim Sin Pang , Ex-NUS Law Professor, Dr Tey , Pastor Kong Hee , Sun Ho ( Pastor Kong Kee’s wife ) & etc. ) to INFLUENCE the society or, BRAINWASH people to become BAD & EVIL .

Also , WORST , even civil servants, or staff under their control / charge are being made to be their almost YES MEN & LACKEYS / WALKING DOGS to do bad things or unethical acts for them , by forcing their staff to obey their ILLEGAL / UNLAWFUL / UNETHICAL ORDERS . . .

So, the Consequence is that you Either join them to be BAD GUYS too , or, You get SACK from your Jobs ! ! ! ]

(3). The KNOWLEDGE & SKILLS of Singaporean work forces are now facing STRONG COMPETITION from other newly emerged economic countries, like China & India .

The Ministry of Education has not change its educational systems much to counter this measures , may be due to Clumsiness , Complacency , Ignorance or WORST , PREVENT from doing so by some Self-Interest Pressure Groups within or outside of Civil Services , through erection of "" PROTECTIONISM "" inside the organizations .

* * * NOTE :==> As Mao Tze Tong, that Ex- Supreme Leader of China once said this words :==> “ If want to undergo Reform or Restructure, MUST first KNOW who your ENEMIES & FRIENDS are “ .

This is BECAUSE Friends will SUPPORT the Reform & Restructure, BUT, Enemies will OPPOSE the Reform & Restructure, regardless of how Good the Reform & Restructure are .

As this Old Chinese saying has highlighted : “ 非我族类，其心必异 “ or, “ 志不同 ， 道不合, 其心必异 “ or, “ 阳奉阴违 “ .
[ It means that anyone that don’t belong to our types or, share common belief & objectives with us, will likely go against us or, oppose us in his / her heart & DISOBEY Instruction from superiors & Top Management ]

* * * NOTE :==> In last Bukit Batok By-Election, DPM Tharman said in public that VOTE Dr Chee Soon Juan to be MP of Bukit Batok is like “ GET A FOX TO GUARD HEN DEN “.

However, our Singapore Government has also “ GET A FOX TO GUARD HEN DEN “ too ! ! !

That is, our Singapore Government is really RIDICULOUS to ask such types of ANTI-REFORM Civil Servants & ANTI-RESTRUCTURE Employers to HELP in the REFORM & RESTRUCTURE Singapore Education system , so as to build up Singapore Economy to be 1st Class Economy & save the Job Security of Singaporean . . . So we can all GUESS out what are the Results ? ? ? ]

(4) Too Many so called “ FOREIGN TALENTS “ come into Singapore & some of them have brought lots of Bad CULTURES & Twisted IDEAS to badly INFLUENCE & BRAINWASH Singaporean population .

[ To Foreigners , certain BAD PRACTICES, like LOOSE SEX CULTURE , SEX - FOR - FAVOR , GAY PRACTCES , CHEATING , CORRUPTION , ” Game of Throne ” ( Chinese is called “ 权术游戏 “) types of BRUTALLY DIRTY OFFICE POLITICS, VIOLENT POLITICAL IDEAS & etc., are OK to them in their own nations & they SPREAD such Cultures & Ideas when they are in Singapore ]

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our ““ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector . . .

What is the use if Singaporean have the BEST EDUCATION when this Cruel Reality in Singapore Labour Market is still IGNORE by Singapore Government :==>

From this website on Subject-Based Banding to replace streaming in secondary schools by 2024 by our Government, Ministry of Education & Singapore Government DON’T seem to care of these BIG PROBLEMS that are widespread in Singapore for many years , or can even say PURPOSELY IGNORE such BIG PROBLEM . . .

Not only blue collar jobs , even white collar jobs of highly educated younger Singaporean & university graduates are in danger too, due to Greedy Singapore employers hire Singaporean temporarily , like 1 - 6 months , & then SACK them with All types of EXCUSES , including Unscrupulously fabricated “ WITCH HUNTING “ Excuses . . .

After these“ ROUGE EMPLOYERS “ have any how SACK many Singaporean Employees from their Jobs , these “ ROUGE EMPLOYERS “ COMPLAIN to Relevant Authorities, like Ministry of Manpower, that Singaporean employees , for both with University Degree & Relevant qualification , are Bad , Lousy & etc. & then , use these “ EXCUSES “ to PRESS Singapore Government to allow more so called "" FOREIGN TALENTS "" or , any one with little educational qualification to be HIRE for PMET Jobs by them , BUT , paid such people with LOW SALARIES :===>

Eg : Engineer with recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE & several years of relevant working experience usually command salary of $3000 - $6000 /month , BUT , FOREIGN "" engineer "" that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years of "" Relevant Working Experience "" in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000/month .

Eg : Architect that had recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE & several years of relevant working experience usually command salary of $6000 - $12000 /month , BUT , FOREIGN "" architect "" that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years of "" Relevant Working Experience "" in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000 - $2000/month .

Eg : Accountant that had recognized Degree from NUS, NTU or other recognized universities by MOE usually command salary of $3000 - $9000 /month , BUT , FOREIGN "" accountant "" that has NO recognized degrees or required certificates & with several years "" Relevant Working Experience "" in other countries , can be paid salary at around $1000 - $1500/month .

[ * NOTE :==>> In other countries, if a person has enough so called "" Relevant Work Experience "", a person can be qualified as "" Qualified Professionals / PMETs "" in their own countries , despite lack of education .

It's like Singapore in 1950s to even early 2000s , when even have Primary School Education alone, is enough to be Top Directors in big companies , like Banks .

( Like poorly educated Bangladeshi / Bangla workers take over PMET jobs, like Engineers & etc. in key industries . . . )

At most, such Cunning Bosses hired these "" CHEAP PROFESSIONALS / PMETs "" & then give them the Positions of IT Engineers , Aerodynamic Engineers , Electrical Engineers , Civil Engineers , Mechanical Engineers , Accountants & etc., in their companies, without letting the clients or, relevant authorities know of the Truth because NOBODY want to CHECK it any way . . . ]

CUT CORNERS a lot to MAXIMIZE PROFITS of Companies & EARN HIGH SALARIES & HIGH BONUSES by Top Management , BUT, DON'T CARE whether can give Good Quality Products & Services OR not , even if end up giving only Bad Products & Bad Services .

These usually happen in Construction Industries, Heavy Engineering Industries & other industries, or companies that are HIGHLY CONSERVATIVE & LABOUR INTENSIVE , in which both UNPROFESSIONALISM & UNETHICAL PRACTICES have BECOME A WAY OF LIFE in the CORPORATE / INDUSTRIAL CULTURES in such industries over many years .

* * NOTE :==> Singaporean Work Force is one of the MOST HIGHLY EDUCATED & BEST in the world, even recognized internationally by reputable international bodies , so Singaporean employees can’t be that Bad or Lousy to be justified easily to be SACK by management of Singaporean employers .

I wonder whether our HIGHLY PAID TOP CIVIL SERVANTS have really CHECK on this PROBLEMS over so many years ? ? ?

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our “ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector , BUT need still quite reliable Non-PAP political leaders, like Mr Mr Low Thi Khiang & now, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, to press such cases to happen . . .

Almost every Minister, Judge and high ranking and highly paid public service official today is a graduate of a university in UK or USA who is fast tracked over local graduates. Foreign grad lawyers are given precedence over local university grad lawyers. Foreign grads take instructions from their imperial masters in the West without any regard for national interests. To keep local leaders in check, the neo Western imperialists set up and support a shadow team ready to takeover if the team in power fails to heed their imperial masters. Which is why the neo imperialists support the local leaders and also the vocal opposition at one and the same time.
In Singapore the government grooms Chinese elites from a young age and even sponsors their training in top universities at Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard.
The Chinese Christian elites are stooges of foreign firms, foreign universities especially Harvard Oxford and Cambridge and of foreign powers and will never mete justice to Singaporeans who are not elite Chinese Christians.
For the last 40 years, Sg gov has been selecting, training and sponsoring Chinese Christian supremacists in Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard amongst other top universities abroad without the whites realising it. These come back and perpetuate Chinese Christian supremacy in Singapore and token meritocracy.
PAP rapidly expanded its elite class these last 20 years by paying million dollar salaries to especially some Chinese Christians especially alumni of Cambridge, Oxford and Harvard to promote them to the million dollar salary club and also by funding their children's education at Harvard, Cambridge and Oxford universities.

Likewise, see the pickle several top-flight British universities are in, being forced to make more places available [at the cost of rejecting able others] for students from 'disadvantaged backgrounds', admitting them with lower school grades, ignoring the reality that such pupils have been let down by the low standards in many British State Schools, from which so many leave after years of compulsory education unable to count, read and write to a decent level, and to conduct a grammatical conversation not riddled with slang.

82,1.0,"Our elites are implementing this new system due to their political consideration. Let me list some of them below:

1) Social stratification is gradually emerging in school

It is getting more common to see more and more non-Chinese students in the technical or normal stream while the Chinese students filled up the majority of the slots in the express stream. For political consideration, our authority is trying to 'break up' the huge pools of non-Chinese students in the technical or normal stream by merging them with the Chinese students in the express stream but they would not be able to do that with our current streaming system, which effectively reinforces the stratification due to the differences in the students' ability.

This is because if you allow too many non-Chinese students to concentrate in a particular area (technical or normal stream classes etc), there is always a political risk that they would band together as a race (especially the Malays who are more united as a race as compared to the Chinese who tend to be self-interested individuals) and turn against the authority. Our political elites want people to unite so they are able to compete better as a group, but not to the extent that the people are so united as to be able to threaten the system or our elites themselves. This is a delicate balancing act that our elites want to maintain.

With this new system, they would be able to merge them into the same class - by combining a smarter 13-year-old Chinese student with a slower but older 14-year-old non-Chinese student in the same class!

If you don't believe me, just take a look around the schools and see the race stratification for yourself that is currently present in our schools. Even for our tertiary institution like polytechnics, after 6 pm, the whole polytechnic would suddenly turn into a 'non-Chinese campus' as the majority of the part-time diploma students who attend night classes are non-Chinese! It becomes a Chinese institution during day-time and a non-Chinese institution at night-time!

2) Divide and control

As mentioned in (1), our political elites are not doing away with school streaming out of their goodwill or kind heart, they are doing this out of their self-interest and political necessity - to 'break up' the huge pools of non-Chinese students concentrated in an area by merging them with the rest. Our elites know that these students would still be able to mix well enough for them to perform in school but not to the extent that they become united enough as a race to form a credible threat to our elites. This is their true agenda - to divide and control when these students are young and not united yet. This is actually a pre-emptive measure.

I would also like to bring to people's attention some of the social stratifications that are already present in the workforce and in the government, if our elites are serious in eliminating such phenomenon, they should look into them seriously as well. Some examples are:

1) Why the majority of the frontline of our Singapore Police Force is stuffed with non-Chinese? Since when does our SPF become a non-Chinese force?

2) Why the majority of the frontline counters of our various government agencies (like CPF, HDB, ICA etc) are stuffed with Malays or Indians? The Chinese cannot do frontline counter jobs? Why are the Chinese so special? Are Malays born to do counter jobs?

3) Why are SMRT staff mostly non-Chinese?

4) Why are grab food, food panda delivery guys mostly non-Chinese?

And many more examples as well.

Even though my highest qualification is 'O' Level, I actually prefer our current streaming system because it allowed me to mix with people who are similar to me, in terms of intellectual level. In my period, we were able to converse well in various topics and since we were also of the same age, we were able to bond well with one another.

Personally, in this new system, I think I would find it unbearable to mix with someone who cannot even understand moderate English, these people are so annoying and stupid and I would find it insulting that they are even in the same class as myself and sitting beside me!

Try mixing long enough with these stupid people and you would end up becoming stupid yourself in time! Stupidity is infectious!

84,1.0,"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

To improve our competitiveness in Global Economy , We really must REVAMP our entire school education system , in actual fact, it should have been Done it in over 20 years ago, during the 1990s .

From this website on “ Subject-Based Banding to replace streaming in secondary schools by 2024 by Singapore Government , it has EXPOSE OUT these BIG PROBLEMS in Singapore that had spread over many years .

Unfortunately, our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ don’t seem to do much on it , though TALK very BIG in Mass Media that our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ is doing so ! ! !

The PROBLEMS that we are facing now are these , due to the very Harmful Effects of "" DON' T CARE "" of or , should say, SACRIFICE Professional Ethics & Moral Education for many years :===>

(1). Bad CORORATE CULTURES & Unethical SOCIAL VALUES are widespread in Singapore Business World & Singapore Society .

Even our so called "" MOST CLEAN & UNCORRUPTED CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD "" , which is Singapore Civil Service , are now affected, due to Big Scandals had happened over these few years, like of SEX – FOR - CONTRACT , SEX – FOR - GRADE , SEX - FOR - FAVOURS, UNDER - TABLE FAVORTISM , CORRUPTION , ABUSE of POWER , INTENTIONAL IRRESPONSIBLE ACTS & etc. .

(2). LACK of INTEREST on the Singaporean on things that affect National Interests & the Well-being of Society , which have led to the terrible consequences of Neglect .

[ WORST , it had led to INFLUENCIAL People , like so called “ ELITE CLASS “ as mention in here , that are Unethical HYPOCRITES & Big CHEATERS ( Like T T Durai , Richard Yong , Peter Lim Sin Pang , Ex-NUS Law Professor, Dr Tey , Pastor Kong Hee , Sun Ho ( Pastor Kong Kee’s wife ) & etc. ) to INFLUENCE the society or, BRAINWASH people to become BAD & EVIL .

Also , WORST , even civil servants, or staff under their control / charge are being made to be their almost YES MEN & LACKEYS / WALKING DOGS to do bad things or unethical acts for them , by forcing their staff to obey their ILLEGAL / UNLAWFUL / UNETHICAL ORDERS . . .

So, the Consequence is that you Either join them to be BAD GUYS too , or, You get SACK from your Jobs ! ! ! ]

(3). The KNOWLEDGE & SKILLS of Singaporean work forces are now facing STRONG COMPETITION from other newly emerged economic countries, like China & India .

The Ministry of Education has not change its educational systems much to counter this measures , may be due to Clumsiness , Complacency , Ignorance or WORST , PREVENT from doing so by some Self-Interest Pressure Groups within or outside of Civil Services , through erection of "" PROTECTIONISM "" inside the organizations .

* * * NOTE :==> As Mao Tze Tong, that Ex- Supreme Leader of China once said this words :==> “ If want to undergo Reform or Restructure, MUST first KNOW who your ENEMIES & FRIENDS are “ .

This is BECAUSE Friends will SUPPORT the Reform & Restructure, BUT, Enemies will OPPOSE the Reform & Restructure, regardless of how Good the Reform & Restructure are .

As this Old Chinese saying has highlighted : “ 非我族类，其心必异 “ or, “ 志不同 ， 道不合, 其心必异 “ or, “ 阳奉阴违 “ .
[ It means that anyone that don’t belong to our types or, share common belief & objectives with us, will likely go against us or, oppose us in his / her heart & DISOBEY Instruction from superiors & Top Management ]

* * * NOTE :==> In last Bukit Batok By-Election, DPM Tharman said in public that VOTE Dr Chee Soon Juan to be MP of Bukit Batok is like “ GET A FOX TO GUARD HEN DEN “.

However, our Singapore Government has also “ GET A FOX TO GUARD HEN DEN “ too ! ! !

That is, our Singapore Government is really RIDICULOUS to ask such types of ANTI-REFORM Civil Servants & ANTI-RESTRUCTURE Employers to HELP in the REFORM & RESTRUCTURE Singapore Education system , so as to build up Singapore Economy to be 1st Class Economy & save the Job Security of Singaporean . . . So we can all GUESS out what are the Results ? ? ? ]

(4) Too Many so called “ FOREIGN TALENTS “ come into Singapore & some of them have brought lots of Bad CULTURES & Twisted IDEAS to badly INFLUENCE & BRAINWASH Singaporean population .

[ To Foreigners , certain BAD PRACTICES, like LOOSE SEX CULTURE , SEX - FOR - FAVOR , GAY PRACTCES , CHEATING , CORRUPTION , ” Game of Throne ” ( Chinese is called “ 权术游戏 “) types of BRUTALLY DIRTY OFFICE POLITICS, VIOLENT POLITICAL IDEAS & etc., are OK to them in their own nations & they SPREAD such Cultures & Ideas when they are in Singapore ]

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our ““ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector . . .

249,3.0,"To Everyone in this Website, Especially PAP, Opposition Parties & All Singaporean,

To improve our competitiveness in Global Economy , We really must REVAMP our entire school education system , in actual fact, it should have been Done it in over 20 years ago, during the 1990s .

From this website on “ Remove streaming in secondary schools to reduce social stratification ”, it has EXPOSE OUT these BIG PROBLEMS in Singapore that had spread over many years .

Unfortunately, our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ don’t seem to do much on it , though TALK very BIG in Mass Media that our “ MOST EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ is doing so ! ! !

The PROBLEMS that we are facing now are these , due to the very Harmful Effects of "" DON' T CARE "" of or , should say, SACRIFICE Professional Ethics & Moral Education for many years :===>

(1). Bad CORORATE CULTURES & Unethical SOCIAL VALUES are widespread in Singapore Business World & Singapore Society .

Even our so called "" MOST CLEAN & UNCORRUPTED CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD "" , which is Singapore Civil Service , are now affected, due to Big Scandals had happened over these few years, like of SEX – FOR - CONTRACT , SEX – FOR - GRADE , SEX - FOR - FAVOURS, UNDER - TABLE FAVORTISM , CORRUPTION , ABUSE of POWER , INTENTIONAL IRRESPONSIBLE ACTS & etc. .

(2). LACK of INTEREST on the Singaporean on things that affect National Interests & the Well-being of Society , which have led to the terrible consequences of Neglect .

[ WORST , it had led to INFLUENCIAL People , like so called “ ELITE CLASS “ as mention in here , that are Unethical HYPOCRITES & Big CHEATERS ( Like T T Durai , Richard Yong , Peter Lim Sin Pang , Ex-NUS Law Professor, Dr Tey , Pastor Kong Hee , Sun Ho ( Pastor Kong Kee’s wife ) & etc. ) to INFLUENCE the society or, BRAINWASH people to become BAD & EVIL .

Also , WORST , even civil servants, or staff under their control / charge are being made to be their almost YES MEN & LACKEYS / WALKING DOGS to do bad things or unethical acts for them , by forcing their staff to obey their ILLEGAL / UNLAWFUL / UNETHICAL ORDERS . . .

So, the Consequence is that you Either join them to be BAD GUYS too , or, You get SACK from your Jobs ! ! ! ]

(3). The KNOWLEDGE & SKILLS of Singaporean work forces are now facing STRONG COMPETITION from other newly emerged economic countries, like China & India .

The Ministry of Education has not change its educational systems much to counter this measures , may be due to Clumsiness , Complacency , Ignorance or WORST , PREVENT from doing so by some Self-Interest Pressure Groups within or outside of Civil Services , through erection of "" PROTECTIONISM "" inside the organizations .

* * * NOTE :==> As Mao Tze Tong, that Ex- Supreme Leader of China once said this words :==> “ If want to undergo Reform or Restructure, MUST first KNOW who your ENEMIES & FRIENDS are “ .

This is BECAUSE Friends will SUPPORT the Reform & Restructure, BUT, Enemies will OPPOSE the Reform & Restructure, regardless of how Good the Reform & Restructure are .

As this Old Chinese saying has highlighted : “ 非我族类，其心必异 “ or, “ 志不同 ， 道不合, 其心必异 “ or, “ 阳奉阴违 “ .
[ It means that anyone that don’t belong to our types or, share common belief & objectives with us, will likely go against us or, oppose us in his / her heart & DISOBEY Instruction from superiors ]

* * * NOTE :==> In last Bukit Batok By-Election, DPM Tharman said in public that VOTE Dr Chee Soon Juan to be MP of Bukit Batok is like “ GET A FOX TO GUARD HEN DEN “.

However, our Singapore Government has also “ GET A FOX TO GUARD HEN DEN “ too ! ! !

That is, our Singapore Government is really RIDICULOUS to ask such types of ANTI-REFORM Civil Servants & ANTI-RESTRUCTURE Employers to HELP in the REFORM & RESTRUCTURE Singapore Education system , so as to build up Singapore Economy to be 1st Class Economy & save the Job Security of Singaporean . . . So we can all GUESS out what are the Results ? ? ? ]

(4) Too Many so called “ FOREIGN TALENTS “ come into Singapore & some of them have brought lots of Bad CULTURES & Twisted IDEAS to badly INFLUENCE & BRAINWASH Singaporean population .

[ To Foreigners , certain BAD PRACTICES, like LOOSE SEX CULTURE , SEX - FOR - FAVOR , GAY PRACTCES , CHEATING , CORRUPTION , ” Game of Throne ” ( Chinese is called “ 权术游戏 “) types of BRUTALLY DIRTY OFFICE POLITICS, VIOLENT POLITICAL IDEAS & etc., are OK to them in their own nations & they SPREAD such Cultures & Ideas when they are in Singapore ]

Really need more “ FIREMAN “ type of Ministers, like Dr Khaw Boon Wah & even Mr Shanmugan, to CLEAN UP , make full HOUSE CLEANING ( Chinese mean : 清理门户 ) & RESTRUCTURE all the MESS that have happened in our ““ MOST EXPENSIVE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE WHOLE WORLD “ & even Private Sector . . .

Of course got lah, but kbkb then sweep the numbers under the carpet and pretend all ok without any systemic changes or thinking of new ideas like this lor: is the streaming also creating classes of people forcing dropouts and not developing full potential of general population ? Wake up lah ! Look at Gifted Programme too which can only inspire elitism. Is Gifted Eductaion necessary especially there is no follow through in Sec School ? The programme is not 'Gifted' too. It is run of the mill Sec 3 do at P5, and renamed as 'Gifted'. Please lah, stop wasting resources like this to aid the general population.
