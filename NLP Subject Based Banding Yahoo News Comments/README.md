# NLP Project on Subject Based Banding/Streaming News
This is a small project on web scraping and various NLP techniques. The objective is to apply several techniques such as sentiment analysis and topic modelling on comments on the recent news on streaming and subject based banding and what insights might come out of the techniques on local news. It is not meant for arguing for or against policy(ies).

## Data
I scraped comments and replies to comments from 4 yahoo new articles and polls related to recent news about streaming and the incoming subject based banding (which contrary to popular belief, is not a sudden move. It has been trialled in schools for some years.). While the total number of comments and replies are not very large, the choice was due to my personal interest in the matter, both as a Singaporean and having been an educator.

## Part 1: VADER Sentiment Analysis
The aim of using VADER was to see how it would perform on comments from Singaporeans (or at least, comments on Singapore news). VADER takes into account punctuation, capitalization, degree modifiers and is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. While it also takes into consideration Emojis, Slangs and Emoticons, I was also curious about how it would perform given Singaporean colloquialisms.
